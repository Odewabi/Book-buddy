# Book-buddy

Final Project Proposal: React Application – BookBuddy: A Personal Reading Tracker
Purpose and Target Audience
The goal of this project is to develop BookBuddy, a React-based personal reading tracker designed to help users manage and monitor their reading habits. The application will allow users to maintain a digital bookshelf, track their progress on books they are currently reading, and set reading goals. The target audience for this app includes avid readers, students, and book club members who want a lightweight and visually engaging way to organize their reading activities.
Core Features and Enhancements to User Experience
1.	User Bookshelf: Users can add books to different shelves such as "Currently Reading," "Want to Read," and "Finished." This categorization allows users to visualize and manage their reading journey efficiently.
2.	Progress Tracking: Each book entry will have an optional progress bar to track pages read out of the total number of pages. This feature encourages users to stay motivated and complete books.
3.	Reading Goals: Users can set weekly/monthly reading goals and monitor their progress toward them.
4.	Search and Filter: A search bar and filter functionality (by genre, author, or reading status) will improve user experience, especially as the library grows.
5.	Dark Mode Toggle: Users will be able to switch between light and dark themes for improved readability and comfort.
6.	Responsive Design: The app will be optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless experience across platforms.
React Concepts and Techniques Used
•	Functional Components & JSX: The entire application will be built using React functional components, promoting reusability and readability.
•	State Management with Context API: The Context API will manage global state (e.g., reading list, theme preference, and goals), avoiding prop drilling and improving maintainability.
•	React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext): These hooks will be used for managing local component states, performing side effects (like loading data from localStorage), and accessing shared context.
•	React Router: For page navigation between the bookshelf, reading goal page, and settings, React Router will be implemented.
•	Local Storage API: Persistent data storage will be handled using localStorage to save books and progress between sessions.
•	Conditional Rendering & Lists: Books will be displayed using map() and conditionally rendered based on user input or category selection.
Design and Aesthetics
The UI will focus on clarity and usability. I will use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and rapid prototyping of responsive layouts. Tailwind’s dark mode support will be utilized to implement the theme switch. Additionally, Framer Motion may be used to add smooth transitions and subtle animations for a more dynamic and modern user interface. Icons from Heroicons will visually distinguish various actions and categories.
